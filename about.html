        <h2>Head of Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          The presentation of a product or service contributes significantly to the end user's overall preception of the organization's quality and concern for their customers. My responsibilities in the company give me the control to create a minimal but friendly atmosphere for customers to stimulate their imagination, but not steal attention from their ideas.
